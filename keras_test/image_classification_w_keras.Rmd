Image classification with Keras.  I would like to be able to tell if there are deer or elk or mountain lions, etc. in an image.  This is the first try to get to that goal.  

I'm working through the following tutorial: [RStudio Basic Classification](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/keras/articles/tutorial_basic_classification.html)

## Load the libraries
```{r}
library(keras)
library(reticulate)

reticulate::use_python("~/.pyenv/versions/3.7.3/bin/python3", required=T)
reticulate::py_discover_config("keras")
```

## Load the fashion mnist dataset from Keras
```{r}
fashion_mnist <- dataset_fashion_mnist()
```
